IK codes for 3-Joints Arm, pertend offset on x-axis for each joints and x/y offset to the center of robot is zero \

`./threeJoints/armDemo` and `./threeJoints/armCustom` are for three-joints arm

`./arm.py` is for mechanisms like 6328's FRC robot(for 2023) where one joint is designed to hold game objects horizontally. Compute angles for two joints and use if statement determine which way the third joint goes, not perfect but worked.
